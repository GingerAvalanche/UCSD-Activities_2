# API Exceptions

Not every call placed to an API will return a result. In this activity, you will use `try` and `except` to handle errors from API calls.

## Instructions

* Loop through the characters in the list, and send a request to the Star Wars API.

* Create a `try` clause and an `except` clause. In the `try` clause, append the height, mass, and character name that is available in the Star Wars API to their respective lists. If the character is not available in the Star Wars API, use the `except` clause to print a message and `pass`.

* Create a DataFrame from the results.
