# Lending Types

In this activity, you’ll practice making two API calls in sequence. The second API call will depend on the response from the first.

## Instructions

* Retrieve a list of the lending types that the world bank keeps track of, and extract the ID key for each one.

* Next, determine how many countries are categorized under each lending type. Use a dictionary to store this information.

  * This data is stored as the first element of the response array.

* Finally, print the number of countries for each lending type.
