# TV Ratings

In this activity, you will create an application that reads in a list of TV shows, makes multiple requests from an API to retrieve rating information, creates a Pandas DataFrame, and then visually displays the data.

## Instructions

* You may use the list of TV shows provided in the starter file or create your own.

* Request information on each TV show from the [TVmaze API's Show Search endpoint](https://www.tvmaze.com/api#show-search)

* Store the name and rating information into lists.

* Store this data in a dictionary, and use it to create a Pandas DataFrame.

* Use Pandas to create a bar chart comparing the ratings of each show.
